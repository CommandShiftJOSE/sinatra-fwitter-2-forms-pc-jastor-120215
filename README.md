# Sinatra Fwitter 2 -  Forms

## Outline

1. Create a new file, `tweet.erb`, to render a form. The form should have inputs for username and status. 
2. Create a route in the controller to render the `tweet.erb` template. Create another route for when the form is submitted. 
3. In the `post` route, create a new instance of our Tweet class based on params. Redirect to the '/' route (instruct users to use `rackup` instead of `shotgun` to run their server, or they won't see the newly created tweet.

## Objectives

1. Understand the difference between a "get" and a "post" request. 
2. Create a form with a method and action.
3. Use data submitted through a form in `params` to instantiate new instances of objects

## Overview

Last time in Fwitter, we created the basic layout of our Model-View-Controller file structure. Today, let's add a form so that users can dynamically create new tweets.
